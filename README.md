go-git
======

Pure-Go implementation of Git as a library.

**MOVED**: Future work on this library is maintained at [https://src.sourcegraph.com/go-git](https://src.sourcegraph.com/go-git).


---


## Origins

This is a fork of [gogits/git](https://github.com/gogits/git) (which was originally a fork of [speedata/gogit](https://github.com/speedata/gogit)).
Unfortunately, gogits/git is [no longer maintained and is not accepting PRs](https://github.com/gogits/git/issues/13#issuecomment-152784720), so this is a new extension of that work.

shazow/go-git is *not* backwards-compatible with gogits/git.


## Goals

### Short term

go-git's API should not be considered stable until these goals have been
achieved.

* [x] Remove features that depend on shelling out to git.
* [ ] Remove redundant features (in progress).
* [ ] Add key features to support implementing sourcegraph/go-vcs's Repository interface.
  (See [shazow/go-vcs#1](https://github.com/shazow/go-vcs/pull/1))
  - [x] Walk tree filesystem
  - [x] Walk commit ancestry
  - [ ] Diff
  - [ ] Blame
  - [ ] Subrepositories
  - [ ] Search


### Long term

* [ ] Add a storage driver interface for repositories with virtual/in-memory
      repository support.
* [ ] Improve test coverage.
* [ ] Improve query performance with caching and bitmap indexes.
* [ ] Rework use of locks (probably get rid of them, require consumer to manage
      repository locking).
